She is respectful of one\'s privacy but always ready to give support when asked upon. Be it in spoken or written form I always got my answers from her within no times. She also proofed to be very flexible in terms of arrival and departure times which I appreciated a great deal. If you are a fan of jazz music (like I am), make sure to double check ahead of time about her current concert dates so as not to miss your hostess on stage like I did (grumble ;-)).\\n\\nThe room I occupied was the smaller one of two that Isabel rents out. So if her flat is fully rented out there can be a maximum of 4 guests plus your hostess in the flat, which can cause some bathroom jam, especially during the hot and humid summer times, when the need for a cool shower is inherent to everyone\'s desire. \\nMy room was as depicted. If you plan on using it for double occupancy, I recommend taking Isa\'s larger room (unless the two of you are very much in love and want to cuddle up close ;-)). Also, if you need a table for writing, ask for the larger room as well, which comes along with one.\\nThe flat itself is absolutely enchanting and furnished with love and an artistic eye to details.

It\'s a 20 minute walk from the beach which is a plus. It\'s located in a very old building on the top floor, so it is rather stuffy and warm in the apartment. The room overlooks a very narrow street/alley so it\'s rather dark and it\'s easy to hear the noise coming from the street and the neighboring apartments. There are a few other rooms in the house that are being rented out, so other people will be staying in the house which makes it a necessity to lock the room when you leave the apartment. \\n\\nIt\'s important to note that this place has a very strict check out time. On our last day, we had an evening flight but had to check out in the morning. When we asked if we could check out late, Isa told us to take our stuff to the train station and use the lockers there, but the train station does not have lockers.

The location could not have been more sentral, still it\'s on \\"the right side\\" of the Rambla, where you can find more independent shops, restaurants, cafes and bars compared to the same leveled streets towards Raval.

Then, I tried to ask for the help from the householder to meet the driver at the airport. After almost one-hour waiting, we are refused by the driver to meet at the airport and He asked us to find his car at the park. How ridiculous! This service costs 20 euro each person but we cannot even have the right to be picked up. We were so angry and chose to take the taxi. At the same time, I texted the householder that we were tired of waiting for the driver and we were on the way to ur apartment by taxi.\\n\\nThe householder didn\'t tell me that I should phone another guy to tell him that we were on the way to the apartment until We arrived. What all she talked about were the money of the pick-up service. We spent another 45 minutes to wait for the guy to send the key. Again, when he came, he talked about the money. We asked for the service, but u did not provide it with us. How dare u to ask for the payment? Besides, do u know what? We are totally seven people, so this service should cost 140 euro totally. But two taxis only cost us 70 euro. The driver knows the guy and the householder.

The apartment is in building with a common courtyard (common for the style). The other people that live in the building were very friendly and helpful answering any questions we had.

The neighborhood is well situated - it is not at all touristy but close to transportation at Plaza Espa\xf1a and Poble Sec metro stops so you can easily get to all the places you want to visit. We stayed here for 3 nights with our two children and found it perfect. We were able to walk or take the metro everywhere we wanted to go, but have a quieter place to sleep and relax. There is a park down the street and a supermarket directly across. Xavi met us on arrival and was very nice and helpful throughout our stay. When my husband accidentally left a few things in the apartment, Xavi collected them and met us upon our return to Barcelona a few days later to return them. Thanks, Xavi! It was a great stay in Barcelona and I would definitely recommend the apartment to anyone looking for space and comfort in a close but quieter neighborhood.

The duplex was very nice and spacious, clean, charming, outfitted with everything we needed, with comfortable beds and a very nice kitchen (with an induction cooktop!).  The property is older and there was some remodeling noise for a few hours from the neighboring apartment, which we could hear through what seemed to be a shared skylight, but it was very brief and not a concern (unless noise privacy is a very high priority, which it wasn\'t for us).  We didn\'t even use the third bedroom with bunk beds, but it would be ideal for a family.  The metro was close enough, and the bakery just downstairs, together with the grocery store literally across the street, were a wonderful convenience.  We went nearly everywhere by metro, and the location was central enough that at the end of the day, if we were too tired to make our way back by metro, an easy cab ride back to the apartment never exceeded 8 euros (which would\'ve been the cost of the metro for all four of us anyway).

Before the trip, we were given immediate and friendly response from host and on the day of our arrival, she came to pick us up at the nearest bus stop, where we took a direct cityflyer bus from the Airport as per our host\'s guidance.\\r\\n\\r\\nApt was tidy, clean, cosy and comfortable for our three nights stay. Host even provided snacks/tidbits and several drink mix. There were bedroom slippers, electric kettle, microwave, cups, bowls and utensils, TV, basic toiletries and hairdryer. We were told that the temperature of the aircon could not be adjusted but that did not affect us at all because the temperature was just right throughout our stay during the rainy season period. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe were also given a precise mini tour of what was in the apt and how we could use the very convenient sofa bed (which we didn\'t use in the end because the third person did not stay with us). There\'s wifi in the apt as well. However, we did experience some connection issues with the TV on one night which we gave up after awhile when we couldn\'t watch the few channels we wanted to. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt\'s a very quiet building located extremely convenient to the MTR, just 2 minutes walk to the nearest exit (and probably another 5-8 mins walk before you reach the MTR gantry). Right across the building on the ground floor there are two popular cafes and one ice cream shop that I would highly recommend and they need no introduction, just (Hidden by Airbnb) it if you\'re a fellow cafehopper/dessert person. \\r\\n\\r\\nIt is also very near the k11 mall, an art mall that I loved a lot and even managed to check out the Urban Sense art exhibition for free! (Because we snapped a photo of the exhibition board and posted it on our social media accounts but thankfully we went in for free as there were nothing much in there and we were basically out in 15 minutes. But still, do check it out if you happen to be there and follow the instructions to get the free entrance!)\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the end of our stay, our host even surprised with a little gift - a box of Jenny Bakery cookies, which we really appreciated a lot :)\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, it\'s a nice, cosy little apt for 2-3 pax accommodation in Hong Kong and definitely cheaper but value-for-money alternative compared to hotel stay. It was smaller than I had imagined since I have only stayed in hotel during all my trips to HK located on the Hong Kong island but truth be told, I wouldn\'t mind heading back to book my stay with Michelle&May, probably check out their other listings which are all also located on Kowloon :)"},{"at":"2016-04-28T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"622f3406e36c59e6164fbc83","fullname":"Phan","imgUrl":"https://xsgames.co/randomusers/assets/avatars/male/19.jpg","id":"30073582"},"txt":"The location is great. 7eleven and Wellcome are just in front of your flat.

The kitchen had all of the utensils and dishes necessary to prepare meals in if wanted.  The appliances were all new and the apartment in general was in great condition.  There are 4 separate bedrooms each with a desk, closet and drawers.  The apartment is in a great neighborhood with easy access to anything you want to do.  We LOVED the area and I enjoyed running in the nearby park daily.  The neighborhood is very safe and we all felt immediately \\"at home.\\" I cannot say enough about the customer service provided by Flatbook.  Upon check we had an issue with the lockbox.  Erika was over within 5 minutes to assist us.  She was kind, personable and professional.  We had a small issue with one the beds that had not been properly assembled.  We sent a message and within hours someone came and delivered a new bed. There was a minor issue with front door of the building as it appeared someone had broken a hinge. This didn\'t really compromise security but I let them know as I thought it would polite.  It was fixed before I saw it again.  I have stayed at hotels with maintenance teams on site that could not provide this level of customer service.  They truly deliver on their promise of 5 star 24 hour service.  I would be thrilled to have future booking accompanied with Flatbook service and can\'t wait to use them again!!!!"},{"at":"2017-06-19T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"622f3401e36c59e6164fab60","fullname":"Bolivar","imgUrl":"https://xsgames.co/randomusers/assets/avatars/male/73.jpg","id":"26478551"},"txt":"Great stay in Montreal!

We were unsure about staying in Queens is opposed to Manhattan, worried that we might feel slightly out of the way, but we had absolutely no need to worry at all - the subway is round the corner (next to the best chinese take-away ever!) and really does take you to the thick of it within ten minutes. There is also a lovely river walk about 15 minutes away which give you the most wonderful views of Manhattan, and there are loungers to relax on at the waters edge!\\r\\nThe house is absolutely beautiful (you can tell Orestes is an architect), you have your own front door and the room is plenty big enough (I stayed with a friend - she slept on the double futon which was very comfy). It also has air conditioning. The bathroom is stunning, with a huge steam room/shower, and it is not shared with anyone else. We were given plenty of fresh towels most days. Orestes\' office is on the same floor and then the back garden is just lovely - a great place to sit and eat a takeaway or, as we did, sit and have breakfast.\\r\\nAs a host Orestes was faultless really! He was very friendly and helpful, and we enjoyed telling him about our day - he was happy to recommend places to see and to eat, but also totally respected our privacy and we felt would have probably left us totally to our own devices if we\'d wanted. He also had a lovely little dog called Kiki!\\r\\nThere was no weird faff with deposits or cleaning fees, everything was simple and wonderful. I honestly can\'t wait to go back and I want to take all of my friends.

Most of the evenings the cigarette smoke was unavoidable, though not too bad if you kept the door to the guest room shut.  (Being first-trimester-pregnant, my nose and nausea levels felt sensitive to this, but I imagine it wouldn\'t be an issue for most folks, unless you had asthma or some other sensitivity.)\\r\\nOn whole, it was a good home base for our week in New York; everyone was friendly and the accommodations were nice."},{"at":"2012-03-13T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"622f3406e36c59e6164fbad5","fullname":"Mistie","imgUrl":"https://xsgames.co/randomusers/assets/avatars/male/47.jpg","id":"1795764"},"txt":"Orestes was a great host!

Fun and funky decor, nice little terrace and ktichen.  Couple of things: 1)  there are two bathrooms- one with toilet, the other with sink and bathtub.  The sink drained realy slowly so was a little discouraging.  Shower was fine, water pressure a little low.  2) our room, the Green Room, is right on St. Denis - trucks ROARing woke us early a.m.  3) be sure to take your room key with you when you go to the bathroom, etc, otherwise your door will lock!

The facilities were fantastic and we enjoyed using the pool (which is also a lot bigger in person) which has stunning views over Rio, including Christ the Redeemer on Corcovado mountain. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful and learnt our faces immediately so we had no problem at all gaining access to the very secure apartment (the staff buzz you in the gates via CCTV). The neighbourhood is more downtown Rio and if you like a good night out it will be perfect for you. We didn\'t feel that the neighbourhood was the safest of areas in Rio, but then again anywhere in Rio during the night isn\'t the safest place to be. The noise from the street at night was sometimes a little loud especially on Fridays and Saturdays which are extremely busy times in Lapa however we understand that this noise is unavoidable and inevitable. It must also be taken into consideration that we were in Rio for the busiest two weeks of the year, during the 2016 Olympics, a time when at night there were hundreds of thousands of tourists on the streets as well as the locals! Despite this as soon as we entered the double electronic gated apartment block we felt completely at ease and safe and during or time in Rio we spent one of the day\'s exploring Lapa, admiring its arches and the colourful artwork and graffiti that the locality had to offer. The apartment was perfect for us, size, location, accessibility were all excellent. Our neighbours were very friendly and helpful and would always say \\"good morning\\" and \\"good evening\\" in the elevator throughout the day. There was a very convenient supermarket just 1 minutes  walk from the apartment and the kitchen had everything you could possible need. If however you prefer to eat out, Lapa has many excellent bars and restaurants and so does Copacabana and Ipanena if you want to travel a little further away. The shower was particularly excellent-hot water was always in abundance. This apartment had everything we wanted and we couldn\'t have asked for a better place to stay during our time spent in Rio De Janeiro for the Olympics. If and when we ever return to Rio Dejanira\'s apartment is the only option for us and we would love to stay there again."},{"at":"2016-09-21T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"622f3402e36c59e6164fae52","fullname":"Fl\xe1vio","imgUrl":"https://xsgames.co/randomusers/assets/avatars/male/42.jpg","id":"67209131"},"txt":"Excelente!

Here are the pros and cons of our experience with this rental: Pros: **Beach access within walking distance **Views **Kitchen well stocked with essentials **Clean and tidy **Beach towels provided (had to get them delivered since none were in the unit as expected, but they came quickly) Cons: **Beds are not comfortable **Pillows could use replacing - they are very flat **All closet doors were next to impossible to open ( this would not have been an issue had there been any sort of dresser with drawers in the master or if the dresser in the second room had drawers that opened, but there wasn\'t and they didn\'t, so we had to live out of our suitcases for the week) **We were told there were sand toys, but there weren\'t. There was snorkel gear and a lone bucket, but no sand toys. A bit of a bummer for the kids who wanted to build sand castles. Things you should know before booking: **this unit is NOT beachfront, it is shorefront. During our stay the water was out far enough at low tide that we could walk on the sand to the nearby beach, but at no point were you able to set up a blanket and play in the sand right in front of the unit. **pictures of the listing are \\"doctored up\\" for lack of a better term. All the decor is the same and it\'s definitely the same unit, but you can tell once you walk in that the images were softened and brightened to add listing appeal. Case in point - I showed my 11 year old the pictures of the listed before we took our trip and upon arrival his first words were \\"this looks nothing like the photos.\\" **that being said, our boys LOVED waking up in the morning when the tide was out and going exploring in the exposed reefs for fish and sea creatures - this is the most redeeming quality of this unit. We did this most mornings as they never tired of exploring, and one morning we even had a few Humuhumu fish shimming right around us when the water was only up to our knees. Very cool. **owner requires a $500 safety deposit that was not explained in the listing at the time we booked, we received a contract after the fact requesting this deposit and the taxes (also not made clear) so you think you\'re paying one total price, but you will need to pay more **you are not allowed to run the AC in the unit at night and leaving windows open to utilize cool air crosswinds is not an option as the birds outside the bedroom windows provide you with a 5am wake up call **we were checked out for 10 days with no sign of our security deposit being returned.

The kitchen had everything that we needed.  We cooked breakfast, cut fruit from the farmers market, made smoothies; every kitchen tool we needed was there for us.

We had 5 guests staying for 7 days. There are 2 bedrooms, 1 with 2 single beds and 1 with a queen size bed and a pull out couch in the living room. The 2 single beds and the pull out couch were in bad shape. Both of the single beds were completely sloped (over used perhaps) and the pull out bed was completely sunken-in, and very very uncomfortable. Aside from the beds, the location and resort was great. The pool was nice and quiet, there is a great view facing the water by the kitchen and it was decently clean. A few notes for potential guests - we did notice a lot of dust on the bedside tables and some dirty qtips on the floor in one of the bedrooms, but we did a few vacuum and sweeps on our own over the week. Also an FYI - there was also not enough toilet paper for the week, so you\'ll have to get your own.

The home is equipped with everything needed for beach/fun (snorkels, massive amounts of towels, play equipment, boogie boards, inflatables, even a couple pairs of water shoes) Unfortunately, because of construction and large waves forming sinkholes, there was a very obstructed view of the ocean due to a temporary fence/cones, plus construction workers walking back & forth across the patio area. This meant the patio area was not as private and not as usable due to the fencing.  Francesco was accommodating in partially refunding us and has been very quick to respond to any issues we had.\\n\\nNote as other reviewers have said, this property is shorefront/oceanfront not beachfront, which means if you stay during a time when there are large waves, you won\u2019t be able to walk out of the patio area and jump in the ocean since there are lots of large rocks lining the shorefront and very little sand/beach space. There\u2019s a beach only 1 block away perfect for kids since it has a natural wading pool with rocks blocking the waves.  This however is not good for swimming and adults will need water shoes to get over the rock barrier."},{"at":"2018-05-14T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"622f3403e36c59e6164fb1ce","fullname":"Vy","imgUrl":"https://xsgames.co/randomusers/assets/avatars/male/36.jpg","id":"175750558"},"txt":"We had an amazing time.

We spent 3 nights here and really enjoyed it. The home has everything you could need... beach chairs, snorkel gear, boogie boards, tons of towels, extra pillows, extra sheets and blankets, pots, pans, coffee maker and much more. Home is right on the shore, but you can easily access the beach to the left or right (just a short walk). Snorkeling out front was wonderful. Lots of fish and we even saw sea turtles. My grandma wasn\'t able to snorkel, but she loved sitting on the Lanai watching the waves with beautiful views of the islands across (I think it is both Molokai AND Lanai?). She even got to see a sea turtle right out front! Francesco was very helpful, friendly and quick to respond with anything we needed. Location was unbeatable too! Close to Front Street in Lahaina, Grocery store 3 minutes away, lots of restaurants and shops within walking distance. It was close to everything but still quiet and private. My family loved Maui and we\'re already planning our trip for 2019 and hoping to stay at Francescos place again!

While I can usually overlook most shortcomings, the list was too many to ignore here. Wide angle pictures & professionally written listing descriptions will impress most - however, here are some takes from my REAL customer experience at the 414 condo:\\n\\n\\"We will provide you with a special code to access the condo after you are booked and paid in full.\\"\\n\\n- After a 13 day stay, we were charged a \\"half day rate\\" for a late checkout for 5 hours over our contracted stay. During our last day, we ended up being locked out of the condo. Thankfully the late checkout fee was refunded due to this situation. Not quite the goodbye from our paradise as we hoped for.\\n\\n\\"This unit includes a window A/C in the living room should you need it although we find it is rarely needed because the tradewinds keep you comfortable.\\"\\n\\n- The AC unit is a measly 12\\" by 32\\" window unit that had trouble keeping even the living room & kitchen areas cool. If 86 degrees in your bedroom while sleeping is \\"comfortable\\", then this might be the place for you.\\n\\n\\"This setting is wonderful for romantic sunset strolls. For the more active person this is a great beach to run on as you can do so for miles in peace away from the crowds.\\"  -- \\"Three miles of quiet sandy beach will entice you to walk, run, or build sand castles.\\"\\n\\n- Haycraft Park is roughly 500 feet away from the beach directly in front of this condo, and it was filled with people every day. Half the time we were here, there were campers there who stayed all day and over night with big fish lines across the entire beach. There may be other listings with better seclusion. \\n\\n\\"This unit is spacious and bright.\\"\\n\\n- Spacious? That\'s a stretch. But bright? You\'re absolutely spot on. If you enjoy sleeping in the dark, this place might NOT be for you. Waking up at 530am is ideal for the lighting of this condo, ever with the window shades (which many times had trouble coming down since they are on automatic motors). \\n\\nA POSITIVE NOTE:\\nOne thing I cannot get over is the real Mahalo spirit of everyone staying and living at the Kana\'i A Nalu resort. While my mother in law and 16 month old daughter got locked out on the last day, many guests there offered help, water, and to hang in their condos while we tried to wait patiently to get back in. The resort has an amazing location and even better spirit within its guests. \\n"},{"at":"2017-12-31T05:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"622f3404e36c59e6164fb471","fullname":"Sue","imgUrl":"https://xsgames.co/randomusers/assets/avatars/male/28.jpg","id":"68844759"},"txt":"Beautiful condo.

Thursday was my actual birthday and this almost had us packing up and heading home - we were minutes away from cancelling the weekend as we had no way of getting in to the house we had booked for 12 guests. We then get inside and everyone starts to arrive and we all shower and use the toilets. By the time we come out the smell of raw sewage is so unbearable that we can\'t use the balcony for the dinner we had planned or open any windows on a hot day in a house that has no air con (not that air con was ever listed or promised however). The smell only got worse throughout the weekend as we continued to use the bathrooms. 6 out of 12 guests chose to leave on Friday as a result - ruining the weekend we had planned for my birthday. Two of the couples who left had travelled interstate for this. So they had paid for 3 nights and only got to stay 1 in rooms that stunk of sewage. This could have and should have been resolved on Friday or Saturday - but no solution was offered and we were expected to stay in a house that stunk of sewage. On top of this on Friday, as we bring items down from the car into the house we place two cases on a shelf along the kitchen wall and it comes off completely and lands on my foot. After looking at how it was constructed, a 30-50kg shelf was screwed together by 4 small screws and was never constructed to hold any sort of weight, making it a danger to guests. And lastly, the alarm. At 2.30am on the Saturday morning the house alarm (that we had been told did not work) began going off and woke everyone in the house. The four surrounding suburbs encountered a blackout and as a result the alarm went to auxiliary power and then went into alarm (the blackout is obviously not the owners fault) The alarm continued to go off for an hour and there was no information anywhere as to how to make it stop. We were left to figure this out for ourselves. The number we called inside the panel had no idea, the host was not contactable and the lady he put us in touch with suggested \\"we push a couple of buttons\\". The house should not have been rented out with the sewage pump the way it was and the host should have information on hand for his alarm system. We know that the host MAY not have known the pump was broken, but we did make him aware as soon as we noticed it within a couple of hours of arriving and no solution was offered for the three day stay.

The location was great it was close to the MTR/public transportation, restaurants, market, etc... The only con to the location is that it was a little hard to get a taxi because coming out of the building cars are not allowed to stop in that area so you would have to walk a bit when taking/coming from a taxi. This has nothing to do with wilson but I thought I would mention it anyways the elevator in this building is extremely slow. The apartment was decent, it didn\'t wow me or anything but as expected places in HK are small. For a group of 9 it was a bit tight but that didn\'t bother us since we were out most of the time. The apartment looks pretty much like the pictures there is one thing I would like to say is I wish Wilson would have taken pictures of the second bathroom to his place kus it was tiny. I\'m a really tiny girl and even I had a hard time in there. So that probably would have changed my mind on picking his place to stay because we were really looking for a 2 bathroom place.

He didn\'t leave until he made sure I went on my bus safely. In my return also his friend came with me to Taksim to make sure that I\'m getting the right bus to Sabiha airport.

Restaurants and shops and aquarium are walkable, and most of the spots on the island you want to be at are no more than 20 minutes away by car. We found the location so convenient and flexible, and were able to do everything we wanted. \\n\\nThe space is even nicer than it looks in the photos, immaculately kept and with everything you could want. It even has tons of goodies for cooking - salts and spices and even olive oil! The box of beach goodies - chairs, boogie boards, a cooler - were super handy and we used them a ton, saved us money too. \\n\\nIf you\'re worried about not having a beach view, don\'t be. The mountain view is gorgeous, and you can walk to the beach in minutes. \\n\\nMahalo, Ralph!

Look no further than this condo because it is a very short walk to the harbor which will cut back travel time and save you money on parking!! I highly recommend dropping by beach bums also located at the harbor for drinks and some delicious BBQ!!! Nice central location on the island makes for easy travel and good time.

When i check the location, had to cancel and rushed to my ultimate accommodation portal, broadcasting generic message to nearby hosts to secure an accommodation the soonest.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlison was among the first to reply, and to pre-confirm...\\r\\nBy the time i got there, Adam was already waiting for me and even kind enough to give me all the directions at 8am and off course waited for me outside to make sure that i\'m paying the right cab fee. \\r\\n\\r\\nWhat can i say Adam, made feel at home from very first moment, kind, genuine and warm welcoming host. The house is is really nice fully refurbished, in a quite and well connected neighbourhood. My room was upstairs, a nice sunny room with  a queen bed and a bathroom attached. After i dropped in my luggage, Adam gave me guided orientation tour to the house, with access to all amenities. \\r\\n\\r\\nFelt like a VIP 5 star treatment as Adam even gave me a pre-paid bus ticket, which made my first(s) bus rides easier as some stations are pre-paid only.  So now that you that i have been at a great apartment, with great hosts, that\'s all, Rozelle is a really nice neighbourhood. walking distance from my hosts\' place, you can make it to the main street packed, with cafe, bars and restaurant, a vibrant market and lot of attractions. if you happen to stay over a weekend don\'t miss Rozelle Market (Sat & Sun). \\r\\n\\r\\nNow the funny part, Adam was so happy to receive me as he\'s a all star backgammon player and he knows that Lebanese people are really good at that and he was so eager for round. One night we decided to play a round and Adam\'s expectations went all down the drain, i think i was the first Lebanese ever to be clumsy backgammon player. We agree that we will play another time via (Hidden by Airbnb) and i will have support from fellow Lebanese players :)\\r\\n\\r\\nAll in all, i great time, the house is warm, clean, and comfortable and the hosts are simply AWESOME  \\r\\n\\r\\n "},{"at":"2014-12-01T05:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"622f3404e36c59e6164fb329","fullname":"Ramon","imgUrl":"https://xsgames.co/randomusers/assets/avatars/male/65.jpg","id":"7277980"},"txt":"Alison immediately replied to my booking request and organised for her hubby to meet me as I was checking in late.\\r\\n\\r\\nThey were very helpful and gave me a bus card to use.

The location is prime, very easy to hop on a bus or subway and make it anywhere. Nightlife is not big around, it\'s actually quiet and nice at night. Dave from USA Stay was super nice and helped solving certain issues that came up. The communication was great.

First, there are cockroaches. First thing we saw upon entering were cockroaches in the kitchen area - without even having any food around or cooking. This was not properly disclosed before arrival. Although they sent somebody over who laid out baits, the roaches did not disappear. Second, (at least) two times there were unannounced strangers entering the apartment in order to look at it or to even take pictures. We know because we were at the apartment at this time. Third, the apartment faces Madison Ave, so it is rather loud. In addition, the windows are not well sealed so it gets cold/hot easily. Overall, considering what you get, the apartment is overpriced. In addition to get the key, you have to travel across the city to pick it up - very inconveniently."},{"at":"2018-11-12T05:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"622f3403e36c59e6164fb029","fullname":"Fernando","imgUrl":"https://xsgames.co/randomusers/assets/avatars/male/58.jpg","id":"98953924"},"txt":"El sitio me pareci\xf3 inmejorable, ni muy c\xe9ntrico, ni muy alejado, y muy buenos transportes p\xfablicos, metro a 10 min. y autobus a piede casa.\\nEl edificio es antiguo, escalera de madera y sin ascensor, pero muy bonito y con balconcillo, tipo Friends.

Paul showed us around the neighbourhood when we first got there and was easily contactable thereafter.\\r\\n\\r\\nPaul\'s place is a unique gem decorated with his quirky eye for colour, style and collectible treasures. It has a cozy well decked out living room, a bedroom with a closet and a comfortable bed, spacious bathroom and a nice, sunny, open-plan kitchen surrounded by windows. It is neat and well organised. There is cooling and heating in every room (plus fans), and the kitchen is well stocked with pots, pans, and other requirements along with a nice big fridge and freezer.  We found the place had everything we needed for a comfortable long-term stay.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor us, the location so close to three big parks (incl. Central Park), Columbia and Harlem, was just right. There are transport options aplenty: bikes up and down Riverside Park, the 1 MTA line two blocks away and frequent Broadway buses.  Paul kindly lent us his two bikes which was a fab way to get around the city. Being located on the border of UWS is great as it is a relatively quiet area to stay but the rest of Manhattan is readily accessible through the 1 line meaning we got the best of Manhattan action combined with good sleeping!

Paul\'s place is awesome! Great space and great location! I was in NYC for 2 weeks at Columbia and the location was just a few blocks away. I didn\'t want to deal with transit in the AM, although that would not have been a big issue anyway.  Plus, it\'s right off broadway (the broadway that has shows) so subways access was great. Since it\'s a college town, I felt super safe and there were minimal tourists and minimal bums also. A couple things to note: this is actually Paul\'s residence so there are some personal affects to be mindful of.  I really appreciated that though because I was able to tap into the Tylenol and bandaids in the medicine cabinet over the course of 2 weeks. Hey, anything can happen!  He was totally respectful of my privacy and wasn\'t popping in or out during my stay.  I\'m hopeful that if Teachers college has anymore trainings that I get to go to, Paul\'s place is available!"},{"at":"2017-09-17T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"622f3403e36c59e6164fb138","fullname":"Gary","imgUrl":"https://xsgames.co/randomusers/assets/avatars/male/70.jpg","id":"109207259"},"txt":"Very safe and close to Columbia University!"},{"at":"2017-10-08T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"622f3406e36c59e6164fbc40","fullname":"Anthony","imgUrl":"https://xsgames.co/randomusers/assets/avatars/male/3.jpg","id":"88343339"},"txt":"Paul is a kind, interesting man who made us feel completely welcome.

Paul, my host, hit it out of the park. The location is outstanding. Such a lovely upper west side block, across the street and around the corner from Columbia. I was visiting my son who is a student there. Even if Columbia wasn\'t your destination, Paul\'s apartment is one block from lovely Riverside Park and the Hudson River. Morningside park is a few blocks to the east. Central Park North and Cathedral Parkway are 5-10 minutes away. The 1 train stops 2-4 blocks away. The UWS is very gracious. The pace is less frenetic which is a nice thing at the end of a day of NYC touring. Yet the nearness of Columbia gives the neighborhood a youthful hip vibe. And Columbia\'s campus is outstanding; lovely and compact. I felt safe coming and going from Paul\'s building. The building was well maintained. The hallway outside his door wasn\'t dark and depressing. There is a laundry in the basement and a garbage chute in the hall on his floor. Paul\'s apartment is decorated with an artist\'s eye; the furniture, art, even the plates and skillets, were beautiful, colorful, special. The kitchen/sitting room was filled with light! Everything was in its place. My bedroom had a very big, comfortable bed. The bed linens were soft; the colors were muted and restful. There was plenty of drawer and closet space. The table lighting was exceptional. I had a lovely view of a church and Columbia outside my bedroom window. Paul was so kind to welcome me very early due to my 5a arrival into JFK on a red eye from SF. He was quickly responsive when I requested my stay. He met me and welcomed me into his home. He made me tea, fruit and nuts. He gave me plenty of towels and wash clothes. He gave me a shelf in the bathroom for my toiletries. I unpacked, showered (plenty of hot water), and headed out to my first meeting. Paul was lovely to talk to, yet respectful of my privacy. He welcomed both of my young adult children into his home. My daughter (who is graduating from NYU) cooked 2 breakfasts in Paul\'s kitchen. She so enjoyed his window seat in his kitchen. My son lingered and did schoolwork at the kitchen table. Paul\'s space was so much more gracious than a dorm room! Paul even printed out my boarding pass when I was out and about. He also printed 36 pages of work that I had completed while spending the day in the libraries at Columbia and the cafes near Columbia while my son wrote a paper. Making that personal connection with Paul enhanced my stay. But he was so quiet and gracious that guests who want to keep to themselves would also be comfortable.

So if you are looking for a place where you really want to taste the chaos with harmony like a real Istanbuller you are very welcome to stay in my apartment.\\r\\n","responseTime":"within an hour","thumbnailUrl":"https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/user/e87810d6-0d69-4187-8862-cc6f9e2fe8ca.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small","pictureUrl":"https://xsgames.co/randomusers/avatar.php?g=male","isSuperhost":false,"id":"22766460"},"loc":{"country":"Turkey","countryCode":"TR","city":"Istanbul","address":"Beyo\u011flu, \u0130stanbul, Turkey","lat":28.97477,"lan":41.03735},"reviews":[{"at":"2016-04-24T04:00:00.000Z","by":{"_id":"622f3402e36c59e6164fae42","fullname":"Oksana","imgUrl":"https://xsgames.co/randomusers/assets/avatars/male/46.jpg","id":"19994980"},"txt":"We rented Aybike\'s apartment as a group of four.
